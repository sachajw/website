# Intro
I thought aliens were not real until I got abducted by the Ortelius open source project, now I am a convert and follower of the beam me up scotty container age. I would like to abduct some of your time to share the process we use to update the Ortelius website. I have the privilege of being one of the community members and contributors to the open source Ortelius project. 

The Ortelius web site runs on [Nginx](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSt--aw7zvAhWGSxUIHYv1D20QFjAAegQIBBAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nginx.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw10RW2cXcmCuZ2YnsYWHFKR) and [Hugo Server](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/).

# GitHub
[Github](https://github.com/ortelius/website) is our source control, and on a side note I am quite famous for getting myself into a pickle with Git and having one of our mentors Steve Taylor untangle my birds nest. Ok back to our initial topic. Lets go and have a gander at a few of the most important files in our repo.

## Dockerfile
We use a multi-staged [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ortelius/website/blob/main/Dockerfile) which starts with a base Nginx build. The build takes place in the working directory ```/build```, where the Hugo Server is substantiated and the node modules are installed. The node modules will be cached unless ```package.json``` changes. The next stage of the build proceeds with a custom container containing Nginx with [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). Google PageSpeed is fantastic, it analyses the content of a web page, then generates suggestions to make that page faster. From there the build is copied from ```/build/public``` to ```/etc/nginx/html``` along with ```/build/conf/pagespeed.conf``` and ```/build/config/nginx.conf``` and finally the PageSpeed cache permissions are rectified.

## Google Cloud Build
Google Cloud Build is watching the GitHub website repo, which will kick off a build when there is a change to the ```main``` branch as a result of the configured trigger. The configuration is stored in [cloudbuild.yaml](https://github.com/ortelius/website/blob/main/cloudbuild/cloudbuild.yaml). We have also enabled Cloud KmS which stores our GitHub SSH key to securely authenticate and Secret Manager which stores our Redhat Quay container registry authentication details.

## Google Cloud Functions
When a build is completed a notification is triggered by our Google Cloud Function which is just eagerly waiting like a Jack Russell chewing your neighbours gate post to send that notification to our Discord channel #bot-build-results. The Cloud Function is built in Nodejs and can be used as a template to add any other providers.

# Redhat Quay Container Registry
Yes and there we have it folks once Google Cloud Build has done its magic a new container magically appears in the [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/ortelius/ortelius) container registry. We use Quay because we have found it to be far more stable and reliable.

# DeployHub
Now enters the mothership [DeployHub](https://www.deployhub.com/) (SaaS) herself, "The one ring to rule them" in a good way that is. Now how does DeployHub know about what went down in the land of containerised micro-services, why the variables in the ```cloudbuild.yaml``` file of course. The information in the variables is recorded in DeployHub.

# Microsoft Azure Kubernetes
We have now reached the end of our journey with DeployHub pushing the container image into Azure Kubernetes to serve [Ortelius](https://ortelius.io/) on a fresh plate of HTML.

# Outro
That's all the time we have this time folks, I appreciate your time and I look forward to you all going bananas giving Ortelius a test-drive and crying with joy as you experience all your containerised aches and pains disappear.
